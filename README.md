## --mic test--

one, two, three  
who is sicker  
than the rapper  
who I be  

grime star, for a sec  
git king now  
believe  

went off the internet  
like social networks  
for a github repo  

its all kinda funny  
cause now I code  
for money, bliss  
and poetry  

who would  
have thought...

I dance 
around the fire
of greatness
and youth 

it’s shadow
is immense 
it’s loneliness 
is couth

alone I dance
in wonder
who would kiss 
a dragon’s tooth
