## whisper good tidings

pick your words  
do your part  
you know your role  
you have from the start  

be a cold soul  
do it all, and  
let the pain go  
be the cold bow  
from which the seed  
that is the truth  
as an arrow  
in the air  
lets its wings show

## African Gangstar

all is fair  
in love and code  
you push a block  
you bless the node  

the source is pure  
the rewards, endless  
to make your pay  
you fight relentless

## Mad Digital

> Verse 1

i write code  
and speak to gods  
i move with mad dogs  
and give out hugs  
but its all not still enough  
yes we build  
on mountains rough  
but where is all the gain  

all i see is pain  
all i see is numb  
each day is all the same  
the hunger for a name  
the hunger for the fame  
what does it all matter  
we will still  
hit the dust  
either way  
one day

> Hook

we all worship  
a digital god  
every sinner in the temple  
one and the same  

it dont matter your name  
it dont matter your game  
we all offer data  
on the altar of the internet

> Verse 2

what it all mean  
its like we are in a movie  
and its all too good  
to be truly true  

its like we are in a zoo  
and the keeper is a warden  
god, is this true of you too  

its probably not that deep  
probably much more steep  
this could be a videogame  
one we cannot win  

no role models  
and we got this far  
and we built this star  
we are the final contellation  
in a sky with a scar

## --who be me--

me, be a lonely king  
I've got the gold  
in bulk  

and more is on the way  
I look to the day  
I have me children  
with souls as warm  
as the desert snow  

I used to be a writer  
I used to be a fighter  
I used to be like water  
always, steady on the flow  

now I work for more  
of the same, of the same  
old glory  

in the end  
the world, will  
watch my holy story

## --full plate--

lie to yourself  
feed on your soul  

there will always  
be one spoon of truth  
even after  
the last bite

## --reflection--

I make art  
do you even care  

I work like gods  
would do  

do you taste the air  

I carve for you  
from hills of hue  

all for a reflection  
of your soul,  
that's past due

## --sudo--

sudo! the power of words  
power of truth  
you know  
we one and the same  
all of the youth

## --merry--

land of the free  
that once held slaves  
home of the brave  
yet full of knaves  

who would have thought  
you would fall so low  
you fought for liberty  
and sold your soul

## --not your son--

send me to die  
and I will rise  
an angel  
out of the dust  

look, I dont like  
my word is double-edged  
and has never known rust  

you think you can  
bully me, into the weak  
man you want  

I aint your son  
my word is born  
its heat does rival the sun

## --home of the weak--

what does the fate  
of young men, dead  
taste like  

I say disgrace  
cause, black aint  
meant to die  

I say you know  
what your sin  
looks like  

god help my soul  
if, for my people  
I wont fight

## --spit it out--

nobody will hold  
your darkened hand  
up, out of the cold  

in case you have not heard  
this story has been told  

we are the children of Ham  
born of the dust. So damn!

there is pity for us  
they have to earn our trust

## --testament--

there is no messiah  
for a preacher  
with no choir  

there is no salvation  
for a people  
with no nation  

black, was just a colour  
till our crimson  
blood did pour  

I am no messiah  
I write hymns  
with no choir

## --flaky whispers--

a cig a day  
keeps  
addiction away  

maybe six  
maybe less  
never more

## --blink--

I am the solemn truth  
bitter strength,  
marked by dark desire  

blunt to the root  
for no one cares  
to kiss my fire  

strange I am called  
all claim to know  
the path I walk  

I am a broken truth  
a drunked preacher  
a sinful choir

## --a dead vein--

what brings no pain  
what tastes the same  
weakness, indeed  
each single day  

what can not play  
what must one pay  
power, indeed  
each, every way

## —baptize—

tobacco leaves  
drowning in liquor  
good men  
can not know stupor  

for to be foolish  
is to be evil  
is to be  
other than good  
in self-purity, relish

## --burnday--

haiku superior  
my flow is injurious  
poetry, what I be  
my flow is  
far from superfluous  

I burn tobacco  
on a Sunday  
on a Burnday  
cause that’s just my way

## --lover’s playground--

underneath a full moon  
three groups  
six hearts  
some full of gravity  
two truly flown  
one unknown  

I would move the earth  
but you would not  
then it did seem  
you feared to love  
he whom love, knew not  

he whom fate forgot  
when she coupled stars  
and bond oceans together

## --my word is born--

I drink smoke  
but never choke  
making money cold  
never broke  

I listen to  
the prophecies  
spoken, by unbelievers  
they hold more truth  
than most of these  
modern deceivers

## --abracadabra--

I am no cold soul  
no lifeless cadaver  
why treat me so  
like a worthless whomever  

a poet filled with pain  
an artist filled with shame  
must I keep quiet  
invisible...  
like a sky, with no weather

## --videogame--

will you be first player  
the slayed, or slayer  
on the battlefield  
of love. I enquire  

laid to waste  
have I been  
I feel so much  
but cannot scream

## --fascinate--

to her I am desire  
pure, full of fire  
liking she can  
love though - Oh never  

the first was vain  
the current is clever  
her cloaks remain the same  
how shall I expire

## --sweet desires--

you taste like  
cinnamon  
pain, you tireless  
lover. Only you remain  

all I wanted was to help  
why must I be broken  
to you bound  
ever yoken

## --depth--

I dance  
around the fire  
of greatness  
and youth  

it’s shadow  
is immense  
it’s loneliness  
is couth  

alone I dance  
in wonder  
who would kiss  
a dragon’s tooth

## --mic test--

one, two, three  
who is sicker  
than the rapper  
who I be  

grime star, for a sec  
git king now  
believe  

went off the internet  
like social networks  
for a github repo  

its all kinda funny  
cause now I code  
for money, bliss  
and poetry  

who would  
have thought...
