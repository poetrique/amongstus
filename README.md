## --mic test--

one, two, three  
who is sicker  
than the rapper  
who I be  

grime star, for a sec  
git king now  
believe  

went off the internet  
like social networks  
for a github repo  

its all kinda funny  
cause now I code  
for money, bliss  
and poetry  

who would  
have thought...

## --depth--

I dance  
around the fire  
of greatness  
and youth  

it’s shadow  
is immense  
it’s loneliness  
is couth  

alone I dance  
in wonder  
who would kiss  
a dragon’s tooth

## --sweet desires--

you taste like  
cinnamon  
pain, you tireless  
lover. Only you remain  

all I wanted was to help  
why must I be broken  
to you bound  
ever yoken

## --fascinate--

to her I am desire  
pure, full of fire  
liking she can  
love though. Oh never  

the first was vain  
the current is clever  
her cloaks remain the same  
how shall I expire

## --videogame--

will you be first player  
the slwyed, or slayer  
on the battlefield  
of love. I enquire  

laid to waste  
have I been  
I feel so much  
but cannot scream

## --abracadabra--

I am no cold soul  
no lifeless cadaver  
why treat me so  
like a worthless whomever  

a poet filled with pain  
an artist filled with shame  
must I keep quiet  
invisible...  
like a sky, with no weather
