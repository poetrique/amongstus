## African Gangstar

all is fair  
in love and code  
you push a block  
you bless the node  

the source is pure  
the rewards, endless  
to make your pay  
you fight relentless

## Mad Digital

> Verse 1

i write code  
and speak to gods  
i move with mad dogs  
and give out hugs  
but its all not still enough  
yes we build  
on mountains rough  
but where is all the gain  

all i see is pain  
all i see is numb  
each day is all the same  
the hunger for a name  
the hunger for the fame  
what does it all matter  
we will still  
hit the dust  
either way  
one day

> Hook

we all worship  
a digital god  
every sinner in the temple  
one and the same  

it dont matter your name  
it dont matter your game  
we all offer data  
on the altar of the internet

> Verse 2

what it all mean  
its like we are in a movie  
and its all too good  
to be truly true  

its like we are in a zoo  
and the keeper is a warden  
god, is this true of you too  

its probably not that deep  
probably much more steep  
this could be a videogame  
one we cannot win  

no role models  
and we got this far  
and we built this star  
we are the final contellation  
in a sky with a scar
