## --sweet desires--

you taste like  
cinnamon  
pain, you tireless  
lover. Only you remain  

all I wanted was to help  
why must I be broken  
to you bound  
ever yoken

## --fascinate--

to her I am desire  
pure, full of fire  
liking she can  
love though - Oh never  

the first was vain  
the current is clever  
her cloaks remain the same  
how shall I expire

## --videogame--

will you be first player  
the slayed, or slayer  
on the battlefield  
of love. I enquire  

laid to waste  
have I been  
I feel so much  
but cannot scream

## --abracadabra--

I am no cold soul  
no lifeless cadaver  
why treat me so  
like a worthless whomever  

a poet filled with pain  
an artist filled with shame  
must I keep quiet  
invisible...  
like a sky, with no weather

## --my word is born--

I drink smoke  
but never choke  
making money cold  
never broke  

I listen to  
the prophecies  
spoken, by unbelievers  
they hold more truth  
than most of these  
modern deceivers

## --lover’s playground--

underneath a full moon  
three groups  
six hearts  
some full of gravity  
two truly flown  
one unknown  

I would move the earth  
but you would not  
then it did seem  
you feared to love  
he whom love, knew not  

he whom fate forgot  
when she coupled stars  
and bond oceans together

## --burnday--

haiku superior  
my flow is injurious  
poetry, what I be  
my flow is  
far from superfluous  

I burn tobacco  
on a Sunday  
on a Burnday  
cause that’s just my way

## —baptize—

tobacco leaves  
drowning in liquor  
good men  
can not know stupor  

for to be foolish  
is to be evil  
is to be  
other than good  
in self-purity, relish

## --depth--

I dance  
around the fire  
of greatness  
and youth  

it’s shadow  
is immense  
it’s loneliness  
is couth  

alone I dance  
in wonder  
who would kiss  
a dragon’s tooth

## --mic test--

one, two, three  
who is sicker  
than the rapper  
who I be  

grime star, for a sec  
git king now  
believe  

went off the internet  
like social networks  
for a github repo  

its all kinda funny  
cause now I code  
for money, bliss  
and poetry  

who would  
have thought...
