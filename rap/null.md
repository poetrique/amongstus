listen to a tale  
of a boy who's learnt to fail  
of a king who's learnt to fly
spit fire and prevail

i was born in no man's land  
land of heat so understand  
i didnt come in hear to play  
i just wanna get my pay  

and i move so wrong i know  
still dont know the way to go  
but i do it for my soul  
do it cause i've got to grow
